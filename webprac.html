        <p>Javascript is a cross platform , object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and light-weigt language. Inside a host environment
             (for example a web browser) , JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its 
             environment to provide programmatic control over them .
        </p>
        <li>
            Client-sided Javascript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its DOM.
            For example Client-sided extensions allow an application to place elements 
            on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks , form inputs and page navigation.

                    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                         different in others .The JavaScript language resembles Java but 
                         does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking .
                         JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax , 
                         naming conventions and basic control-flow  
                         constructs which was the reason it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript

                    "function greetme(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello + yourName);
                     }
                     greetMe("World");
                      "
                </code>
